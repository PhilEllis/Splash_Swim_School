# Welcome to Splash Swim School!

 Welcome to **Splash Swim School!** 
  

Founded by two dedicated mothers, Splash Swim School has evolved from its humble beginnings as a small local swim class into a remarkable institution exclusively focused on delivering high-quality swimming lessons for children of all skill levels. This exceptional swim school has not only flourished but has also emerged as the premier destination for parents seeking the best swimming education for their children.

  

Despite the impressive growth of Splash Swim School, their online presence has not kept pace with their physical expansion. With a limited online presence restricted to social media, Splash Swim School has now recognised the urgent need for a comprehensive website. This website will not only align with their brand identity but also enhance their daily operations by providing streamlined services to both parents and staff.

  

The Splash Swim School Website and Database System will be a web-based platform designed to streamline the registration process for parents and improve course management for the swim school. The system will allow parents to easily select and pay for swim courses, create parent and child profiles, and provide essential information. For the swim school, it will facilitate efficient course capacity & payment management, enrolment tracking, and access to crucial child details.

**The main Business Needs are:**

  

-   **Clear Course Information:** Splash Swim School needs a clear and concise method of communicating the specific swim levels they offer and defining the prerequisites for each level. This is crucial to ensure that only capable children are enrolled in appropriate courses and to prevent course swapping after the initial class which majorly impacts course capacity levels and the required staff to children ratios.  
    
-   **Streamlined Payment Process:** The school is seeking an efficient payment system that eliminates the need for persistent follow-ups with parents for class fees. Their goal is to receive full payment at the time of booking.  
    
-   **Standardised Child Information:** To enhance both insurance and operational aspects, Splash Swim School requires standardised child data. Currently, information provided by parents via email often lacks key details, leading to administrative efforts to collect missing information.  
    
-   **Flexibility in Level Changes:** The swim school needs the capability to facilitate course level changes for children according to their abilities. Some students may excel quickly and require advancement to higher levels early in their course and others may need the support of a lower course.  
    
-   **Enrolment Management:** Staff require the ability to remove a child from a class when necessary is essential for efficient management of course capacity levels.  
    

These business needs are not only aimed at improving the operational efficiency of the Swim School but are also designed to provide a more streamlined and informed process for parents, enhancing their overall experience. Addressing these business needs will optimise staff efficiency by reducing administrative hours spent on enrolment, payment tracking, and capacity management. This, in turn, will free up staff hours allowing the business to enhance lesson quality through increased teacher-to-child ratios.

## Credits

>### Code 

- The majority of the html code originated from the Bootstrap library and was styled with custom css.
- The core of the application has been derived from the code Institute Relational Database Walkthrough and amended to fit the needs of my application. This includes the add_note, edit_note & delete_note functions The base of the code was taken from the walkthrough and edited to fit the functionality of this app. I have referenced it here instead of the routes.py as i belived it to be too messy and disturb the code on the .py file.
- [prettyprinted](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8aTnmsDMldY&list=PLXmMXHVSvS-CoYS177-UvMAQYRfL3fBtX&index=72) The user authentication code has been modeled from this video and adapted suit the needs of this project. I found it hard to detail which changes came from this video without disrupting the flow of the code so have referenced it here instead. The Login, logout and sign up functions and use of WTForms has been based on this walkthrough and edited to suit the needs of this app. I did view all of his Flask videos and found it helped with understanding how flask-login worked alongside the other libraries.
- [Bootstrapmade](https://bootstrapmade.com/) - I utilised a portion of html & css from the GP & Green templates for the lists section on the home page and the section titles on the home page and about page.
- The modal has been taken from bootstrap and the javascript used to initiate it has been taken from a youtube video which i have now lost the link to but i wanted to make it clear it was not my own code.
- All of the rest of the code was written by the author - Philippa Ellis
