      <h3>Seahorse</h3>
      <p>Level 1 - Seahorse is suitable for those who are young and new to the water or those slightly older children who are not confident or unsure in the water. At this level our main swim teacher will have additional teachers in the water with them to help your child navigate this new watery world safely and with confidence.</p>

          Seahorse is for beginners and although we do have additional help in the water at this stage we also need your child to be able to do the following to help ensure we deliver a safe course. Your child’s feeling of safety in the water will directly correlate to their confidence in the water so it is important we get this right.
