      <h3>Frog</h3>
      <p>Level 2 - Frog is ideal for children who have graduated from the Seahorse level. It's for those who are now confident in the water and can swim a few meters without the aid of floats. With fewer instructors in the water, children at this level start to develop greater autonomy.</p>

          Frog swimmers still need alot of support in the water and although we do have additional help in the water at this stage we also need your child to be able to do the following to help ensure we deliver a safe course. Your child’s feeling of safety in the water will directly correlate to their confidence in the water so it is important we get this right.

                Don’t worry this happens from time to time. On your Childs first class the swim teacher will be assessing their ability, should they belief that your child belongs in a different level they 
                will be able to facilitate this for you. Your time and location of class won’t change, your child will simply move lanes and be under the care of the appropriate level teacher.

                The progression from Seahorse to Frog varies for each child. It depends on their comfort and confidence in the water, as well as their ability to swim a few meters
                 without floats. Regular practice and encouragement are key to a swift and smooth transition.
